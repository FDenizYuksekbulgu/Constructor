# Constructor

In this example, a baby class defined with a constructor with and without parameters was created.
A Baby class was defined.

Baby class properties -> Date of Birth, Name, Surname

Two constructors were defined for the Baby class.

The first is a method that does not take parameters in the Default Constructor style.

The second is an alternative constructor that takes the Name and Surname parameters and assigns the values ​​to the properties during the renewal process.

When a baby object is created in the 2 Constructors, a "Ingaaaa" text should be seen on the console screen and the Date of Birth should be assigned as that moment.

After the definition, a baby object was defined with both constructors and its properties were written to the console screen.
